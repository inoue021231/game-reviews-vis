Heed my warning, those of you who are wise, and do something that brings you genuine joy instead. The people who still play this game are afflicted souls who will never find peace. Screw the devs and all those in the playerbase who make this game a living hell. God bless you and have a great day!",

I went to the effort of recording footage of the problems and sharing it the devs so they could improve their product and asked for a refund. They refused to give me a refund because I'd played for slightly too long. I wish I hadn't gone to the effort to help them improve their product. Won't be buying anything from them again.",
